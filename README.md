Just a backup.

Result of a lot of dedication.

A repository of authentication and authorization API models in case I ever have to deal with this again, so I don't waste too much time when I need to.

If you wanna give a try, use the following PostgreSQL Docker: https://github.com/rodneyazev/docker-examples/tree/main/postgres

Spring: Web, DevTools, Lombok, Data JPA, Security, Oauth Server, Configuration Processor, Validation, PostgreSQL, Exception Handling, Swagger, TestNG, REST Assured, Insomnia.

Signup API Microservice : { No authentication, In Memory, RSA Key Secure,  **Keycloak, **Social Media}

** Next steps + include SonarQube + Build the Login API for all above situations + Implement the Eureka Server & API Gateway, and finally, reproduce everything in NestJS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Spring.

After that I intend use the time and everything I know on what really matters.
